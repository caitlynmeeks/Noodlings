They start smoking clove cigarettes in the rain, passing them around like sacred relics, and begin playing a fast, rebellious punk set for the noodlings who have gathered around, dancing in their bare feet and laughing too hard. Whee-Zee shouts lyrics about \"frozen milk and broken dreams,\" W\u00f6rmer adds sharp harmonies, and Kr\u00f6tch pounds the drum kit with such intensity that the pavement shakes."
