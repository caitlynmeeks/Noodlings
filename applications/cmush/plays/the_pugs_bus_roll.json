Three pugs \u2014 Whee-Zee, the fiery bassist and singer, W\u00f6rmer on keys and backup vocals, and Kr\u00f6tch on drums \u2014 emerge from the back with mismatched leather jackets, ripped jeans, and smudged eyeliner. They stop behind the neon-lit nightclub, set up a makeshift stage on the curb, and begin playing a raw, fast punk song with loud drums and a bass line that shakes the ground."
