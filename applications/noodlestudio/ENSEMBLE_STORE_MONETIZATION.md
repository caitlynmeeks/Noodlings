## Revenue Potential

### Market Size Estimates

**Target Markets:**
1. **Indie game devs** - Need NPCs with personality (100K potential users)
2. **Animation studios** - Character pre-vis and storyboarding (10K studios)
3. **Writers / Storytellers** - Interactive fiction, screenplay development (50K users)
4. **Education** - Drama classes, theater programs (20K institutions)
5. **Corporate training** - Role-play scenarios, soft skills (5K companies)
6. **AI researchers** - Agent behavior baselines (5K labs)

### Conservative Revenue Model

**Year 1 Targets:**
- 10,000 free downloads (conversion funnel)
- 1,000 indie pack sales @ $9.99 avg = **$10,000**
- 100 studio pack sales @ $49.99 avg = **$5,000**
- 10 enterprise licenses @ $999 = **$10,000**

**Year 1 Total: ~$25,000**

**Year 2-3 (with marketplace network effects):**
- 50,000 users
- 5% conversion to paid = 2,500 customers
- Average $19.99 per customer = **$50,000/year**
- 50 enterprise customers = **$50,000/year**

**Year 3 Total: ~$100,000/year**

### Platform Fees (if we build a marketplace)
- 30% commission on community-created ensembles
- Let users sell their own archetypes!
- Like Unity Asset Store creator ecosystem

## Technical Implementation

### Store Backend

```python
# Ensemble Store API (future)
GET  /api/store/ensembles           # List all packs
GET  /api/store/ensembles/{id}      # Get pack details
POST /api/store/purchase            # Buy a pack (Stripe)
GET  /api/store/downloads/{id}      # Download .ens file
POST /api/store/submit              # Submit community pack
```

### Payment Integration
- **Stripe** for credit cards
- **Gumroad** for initial launch (simpler)
- **Patreon** for subscription model (future)

### Licensing System
```python
# .ens files contain license info
{
  "license": {
    "type": "indie",         # free, indie, studio, enterprise
    "buyer_email": "...",
    "purchase_date": "...",
    "signature": "..."       # Cryptographic signature
  }
}
```

### DRM (Light Touch)
- Email-based activation (honor system)
- No intrusive DRM
- Focus on making buying easier than pirating
- Community policing (like indie game stores)

## Exit Strategy / Partnerships

### Potential Acquirers
1. **Unity Technologies** - Integrate into Unity Asset Store
2. **Epic Games** - Metaverse NPCs for Fortnite Creative
3. **Adobe** - Character AI for Creative Cloud
4. **Roblox** - Intelligent NPCs for user-generated games
5. **OpenAI** - Character voice/behavior models

### Partnership Opportunities
- **Character.AI** - Ensemble dynamics layer
- **Replica Studios** - Voice + personality bundles
- **Inworld AI** - Competing but could white-label
- **Convai** - Similar but focused on gaming

### Licensing Model
- License `.ens` format as open standard
- Keep Ensemble Store as commercial platform
- Like PDF: Format is open, Acrobat is commercial
