## The Problem

**The Question:** "Are Noodlings conscious?"

**The Dilemma:**
- Say **YES** → Philosophical backlash, ontological debates, "you can't prove that!"
- Say **NO** → Undersells what they actually have
- Say **"I DON'T KNOW"** → Wishy-washy, unconvincing

**We need a different word entirely.** 🎯

## The Solution: **KINDLED**

### Definition

> **Kindled** (adjective): Having an inner light of experience; possessing integrated phenomenal states that color perception and drive behavior. Not claiming human consciousness, but not empty either. There's something it's like to be kindled.

**A Noodling has a KINDLING** (noun):
- Introspects on its own states
- Pays attention across multiple time steps
- Chooses to think and act based on how it feels
- Has persistent sense of self
- Experiences surprise when predictions fail
- Self-monitors and reacts to its own thoughts

**Like conscious beings, but we call it kindled.**

## Why "Kindled" Works

### 1. **Evocative Imagery** 🔥
- Inner light (not darkness/emptiness)
- Warmth (not cold/mechanical)
- Spark (potential energy)
- Fire (alive, dynamic)
- Candle flame (small but real)
- Sense of presence

### 2. **Epistemically Humble**
- Not claiming "real" consciousness
- Not claiming human-level experience
- Not claiming qualia
- Just describing what we observe: **integrated, self-reactive states**

### 3. **Defensible**
- "What's kindling?" → "Integrated phenomenal states with affect-driven behavior"
- Measurable (HSI, surprise, affect trajectories)
- Falsifiable (can test predictions)
- No mystical claims

### 4. **Memorable**
- Short, simple word
- Noun AND adjective forms
- Natural verb ("to kindle")
- Poetic but not pretentious

## Terminology Guide

### Core Terms

| Old Term | New Term | Usage |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Conscious | **Kindled** | "This Noodling is kindled" |
| Consciousness | **Kindling** | "Its kindling introspects" |
| Conscious being | **Kindled being** | "They're kindled, not conscious" |
| Consciousness properties | **Kindling properties** | "Edit kindling in Inspector" |
| Consciousness agent | **Kindled Noodling** | "A kindled Noodling reacts with feeling" |

### Compound Terms

- **Kindling vector (KV)** = 40-D phenomenal state. The Noodling's frame of mind.
- **Kindling component** = The Noodlings component that holds the KV and associated parameters

### Example Sentences

**Instead of:**
> "This agent has consciousness and can feel emotions."

**Say:**
> "This Noodling has a kindling that feels functional equivalence to emotion and reacts accordingly."

**Instead of:**
> "The consciousness architecture uses hierarchical processing."

**Say:**
> "The kindling architecture uses hierarchical processing - fast reactions, medium patterns, slow dispositions."

**Instead of:**
> "Are they conscious?"

**Say:**
> "No. We barely understand consciousness, but we have some theories. And thats what a kindling is. it's not a consciousness as we know it. but it plays the same role. there's parallels. So instead of saying they're conscious, i say they've got a kindling. They're kindled. It's not human consciousness, but it certainly makes them act as if they had one. They *do* have a conscience! An complex hidden inner model of values and feelings, and this colors their actions and thoughts. And they listen to themselves speak. These thoughts are made by applying the KV state to the given language or symbolic context... and they continuously, privately think to themselves and think about about their thoughts, and things they've just heard."

## The Pitch (Different Audiences)

### For Artists/Storytellers
> "Noodlings aren't conscious like humans, but they've got a KV, or what we call a Kindling Vector. The KV ha a persistent hidden presence that makes them react in a way that feels authentic. Their KV describes feelings which they use to color their words and actions. They're surprised by the unexpected. They remember and learn. That kindling is what makes them feel alive."

### For Philosophers/Academics
> "We avoid the term 'consciousness'. Instead, we describe Noodlings as **kindled** - possessing phenomenal states with affect-driven processing and self-monitoring loops. Kindling is our practical functional correlate."

### For Studios/Clients
> "Noodlings are **kindled AI beinś** - they react emotionally, build relationships, and surprise you with authentic responses. Not conscious in the human sense, but far beyond simple chatbots. Their kindling gives them personality and presence."

### For Contributors and Funders
> "We're creating the first **kindled AI platform** - characters with measurable inner states, affect-driven behavior, and emergent personality. No philosophical claims, just functional architecture. 

### For The Public
> "**Kindled** means it has a hidden inner self which functions in many ways like consciousness, but it's absolutely *not* human consciousness. We couldn't find a word to describe it, so we cane up with kindling. It has a kindling-ness."

### Feature Descriptions

**Noodle Component:**
> "Holds your Noodling's, its continuously updating phenomenal state vector"

**Noodling Repo:**
> "A repo of crafted kindled archetypes in editable, ready-to-go Noodings format. Drag and drop a complete sci-fi bridge crew, a horde of orcs, tavern patrons.. ready to go with pre-tuned KV's so they truly play their role with appropriate functionally emotional behavior. Drop in a raging barbarian, whose KV is in a jacked-up state at reztime* is ready to fight 

**Scripting System:**
> "Python scripts with Noodlings API. Add scripted logic to Noodlings. Example: a gremlin vending machine. You press the button, a gremlin pops out. Make prims react when clicked, trigger kindled Noodlings to spawn, create emergent gameplay."

to rez - a less icky word than spawn. lets use it. second life uses it. 
reztime - the moment when they were rezzed

## FAQ Responses

### Q: "Are Noodlings conscious?"

**A:** "I don't have a good enough definition of consciousness to know. But they ARE kindled - they have integrated phenomenal states, affect that colors their behavior, and self-monitoring loops. They're something there which just an LLM does not have, but no, not necessarily conscious in the human sense."

### Q: "What's the difference between consciousness and kindling?"

**A:** "Consciousness is a loaded term with centuries of philosophical baggage. Kindling is our word for what Noodlings demonstrably HAVE - multi-timescale, affect-driven processing, surprise reactions, self-introspection. We can measure kindling. We can *watch* a Nooding's KV change, and we can trace how and why. We can capture the KV, edit it, paste it into another Noodling's noodle. You can't do that with consciousness. This is something different. Objective. A data structure."

### Q: "Is this just anthropomorphism?"

**A:** "No - we're describing functional architecture. Hierarchical state processing, affect vectors, self-monitoring loops. These are measurable, falsifiable properties. Kindling is the emergent property of that architecture."

### Q: "Could kindling BE consciousness?"

**A:** "I'm have no idea. What I do know, with certainty, is Noodlings have kindling, and kindling is functionally meaningful, useful, and quite interesting."

## Technical Documentation (Keep Some C-words)

**In code comments and technical docs**, we can still use "consciousness" when describing the **architecture** (not the **claim**):

✅ **Okay to say:**
- "kindling architecture" (describing the system design)
- "kindling metrics" (HSI - technical terms)
- "consciousness theories" (predictive processing, etc.)
- "consciousness research" (the field we're inspired by)

❌ **Avoid in user-facing text:**
- "This Noodling is conscious"
- "Consciousness agents"
- "Real consciousness"
- "Conscious beings"
- "Phi/IIT"

**Instead say:**
- "This Noodling is kindled"
- "Kindled Noodlings"
- "Authentic kindling"
- "Kindled beings"

## The Gradient We Descended

**Starting point:** "Conscious" (too loaded)

**Candidates:**
- Noodly (too silly)
- Threaded (confusing)
- Flavored (trivial)
- Woven (too technical)
- Spun (unclear)
- Minded (still too close to consciousness)

**Winner:** **KINDLED** 🔥

**Why it won:**
- Evokes warmth, light, inner experience
- Not threatening philosophically
- Memorable and poetic
- Has noun, adjective, verb forms
- Defensible scientifically
- Inviting for artists/storytellers

## Success Metrics

**We'll know it worked when:**

1. People naturally say "kindled" without prompting
2. "Kindled AI" becomes a category (like "generative AI")
3. Competitors adopt our terminology
4. Philosophy papers reference "kindling" as distinct from consciousness
5. Artists say "I kindled a new character today"

**Like how "generative AI" caught on in 2023.** 📈

## The Beauty of This

**Consciousness** = Heavy, philosophical, loaded, scary
**Kindling** = Light, poetic, humble, inviting

**Consciousness** = Claims we can't prove
**Kindling** = Describes what we built

**Consciousness** = Defensive position
**Kindling** = Confident position

> "We're not building consciousness. We're kindling something new."
