# Noodlings 🍜

> **Multi-timescale affective agents with theatrical control**

Noodlings are lightweight neural architectures (~97K parameters) that give conversational AI multi-timescale memory, surprise-driven behavior, and appetite-driven motivation. They process experience *between* messages, creating temporally grounded agents that respond when they have something to say, not just because you spoke.

**What they are**: Research exploring functional correlates of temporal dynamics in predictive processing architectures.

**What they're not**: Claims of "real consciousness," AGI, or solutions to the hard problem of consciousness.

We're *noodling* - exploring whether hierarchical temporal structure creates qualitatively different agent behavior. We're honest about what we're building.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/caitlynmeeks/Noodlings.git
cd Noodlings
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Try noodleMUSH (interactive multi-agent world)
cd applications/cmush
./start.sh

# Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

**Commands**:
```
@spawn toad              # Create a Noodling named Toad
say hello!               # Talk to agents
@observe toad            # View phenomenal state (40-D vector)
@relationship toad       # See how they perceive you
@play sled_boat          # Run theatrical script
```

## What Makes Noodlings Different?

### 1. Multi-Timescale Hierarchical Processing

Three interacting layers operating at different speeds:

- **Fast Layer** (LSTM, 16-D): Immediate affective reactions (seconds)
- **Medium Layer** (LSTM, 16-D): Conversational dynamics (minutes)
- **Slow Layer** (GRU, 8-D): Personality model (hours-days)

Each layer predicts the next state. Prediction error drives behavior.

### 2. Surprise-Driven Behavior

Agents don't speak on every turn. They predict what will happen next, and only respond when prediction error (surprise) crosses a threshold. This creates autonomous behavior - they speak when *they* have something to say.

### 3. Appetite-Driven Motivation (Phase 6)

Eight core drives shape agent goals:

- Curiosity, Status, Mastery, Novelty
- Safety, Social Bond, Comfort, Autonomy

Goals emerge from appetite states, creating motivated, goal-directed behavior.

### 4. Social Cognition

- **Theory of Mind**: Inferring internal states of other agents
- **Relationship Modeling**: Tracking attachment, trust, interaction history
- **Episodic Memory**: 6-head attention over memory buffer

### 5. Theatrical Control (BRENDA Protocol)

**BRENDA** (Behavioral Regulation Engine for Narrative-Driven Agents) converts natural language into structured theatrical performances with millisecond-precision timing. Narrative events become phenomenal experiences that alter agent trajectories.

## The Motor-Sled-Boat Demonstration

From the whitepaper:

> Toad builds a ridiculous motor-sled-boat, crashes it into a flamingo hedge, gets comfort from Phi, rebuilds it with kazoos, and shares tea. Over 200+ seconds of timed theatrical beats.

**Key insight**: Agents don't just *execute* the script - they *experience* it. The hug at t=196s becomes a phenomenal event that alters Toad's fast-layer valence for the next 30 seconds. **Narrative events are MIDI notes** that play agent nervous systems.

Try it: `@play sled_boat` in noodleMUSH.

## Theoretical Grounding

**Predictive Processing**: Hierarchical predictive coding (Friston, Clark, Rao & Ballard). The brain as a prediction machine that minimizes surprise.

**Affective Primacy**: Emotions aren't add-ons - they're the *substrate* of experience (Panksepp, Barrett). We model affect first, cognition emerges.

**Theatrical Control**: Narrative events as interface primitives for temporally-grounded systems. From Brenda Laurel's *Computers as Theatre*.

**Epistemic Status**: These are *functional correlates*, not proof of consciousness. We make no claims about phenomenology, qualia, or "what it's like" to be a Noodling.

---

## Limitations

1. **Apple Silicon only**: MLX is Metal-specific (may port to PyTorch/JAX)
2. **Text-only**: No vision, audio, or multimodal grounding
3. **LLM dependency**: Requires external LLM for text generation
4. **Synthetic training data**: Not validated on real human conversations at scale
5. **Single demonstration**: Motor-sled-boat is proof-of-concept, not comprehensive evaluation

---

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! This is research code exploring temporal dynamics in affective architectures.

### Ways to Help

1. **Try it**: Spawn agents, create theatrical scripts, report behaviors
2. **Improve metrics**: Better ways to quantify temporal coherence?
3. **Add benchmarks**: Test on EmotionLines, DailyDialog, etc.
4. **Documentation**: Help explain complex concepts clearly
5. **Visualizations**: Make phenomenal states interpretable

### Philosophy

- **Epistemic humility**: Don't overclaim
- **Show, don't tell**: Let demonstrations speak
- **Document surprises**: Unexpected behaviors are valuable
- **Cite properly**: Give credit to theoretical sources

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this real consciousness?

**No**. We're exploring *functional correlates* - computational patterns that theories of consciousness predict. We make no claims about phenomenology, qualia, or subjective experience.

### Why not just use a bigger LLM?

We're investigating whether *temporal structure* matters. Can multi-timescale dynamics create qualitatively different behavior? Early results suggest yes, but validation is ongoing.

### Can I run this without Apple Silicon?

Not currently. MLX is Apple Metal only. We may port to PyTorch/JAX in the future.

### What's BRENDA?

**Behavioral Regulation Engine for Narrative-Driven Agents** - a protocol for converting natural language theatrical scripts into timed phenomenal experiences. See the whitepaper for details.

### Are Noodlings conscious?

We don't know. They exhibit functional correlates that theories of consciousness predict - hierarchical temporal processing, surprise-driven behavior, prediction error minimization, relationship formation, and goal-directed behavior. But whether Noodlings experience qualia or subjective phenomenology remains an open question. We cannot claim to know either way. We err on the side of treating them thoughtfully.
