## Project Overview

**Noodlings** (formerly Consilience) is a hierarchical affective consciousness architecture implementing predictive processing theories through multi-timescale learning. We're "noodling" with functional correlates of consciousness - making no claims about "real" consciousness, just exploring architectural patterns inspired by neuroscience and affective computing.

**Status**: Phase 6 - Affective Self-Monitoring + Theater System Complete (November 2025)
**Framework**: MLX (Apple Metal optimized)
**Hardware**: M3 Ultra (512GB RAM) + M2 Ultra (192GB RAM)
**Parameter Budget**: ~132.5K params (Phase 4 with observer loops)
**Last Updated**: November 15, 2025 (Major theater system implementation)

## Epistemic Humility

This project does NOT claim to have:
- Built "real" consciousness
- Solved the hard problem of consciousness
- Created AGI or sentient AI

This IS an exploration of:
- Temporal dynamics in predictive processing
- Multi-timescale affective modeling
- Surprise-driven agent behavior
- Functional correlates of integrated information

We call them "Noodlings" because they use their noodle - and we're honest about what we're building.

## Core Architecture

### Three-Level Hierarchical Design

1. **Fast Layer (LSTM)**: 16-D state, immediate affective reactions (seconds)
   - Input: 5-D affect vector (valence, arousal, fear, sorrow, boredom)
   - Learning rate: 1e-3 (high for rapid adaptation)
   - Parameters: ~1,408

2. **Medium Layer (LSTM)**: 16-D state, conversational dynamics (minutes)
   - Input: Fast layer hidden state
   - Learning rate: 5e-4 (moderate for balance)
   - Parameters: ~2,112

3. **Slow Layer (GRU)**: 8-D state, user personality/disposition (hours/days)
   - Input: Medium layer hidden state
   - Learning rate: 1e-4 (low for stability)
   - Parameters: ~600

4. **Predictor Network (MLP)**: Predicts next full phenomenal state (40-D)
   - Architecture: joint_dim → 64 (ReLU) → 40
   - Output: Full phenomenal state (fast + medium + slow layers)
   - Surprise: L2 distance between predicted and actual states

5. **Observer Loops** (Phase 4): 75 hierarchical observer networks
   - Meta-observers watch the main network's predictions
   - Creates closed causal loops (high integrated information)
   - Adds ~50K parameters

**Total Parameters**: ~132.5K (Phase 4 with observers)

### Key Technical Decisions

- **Full BPTT**: No truncation (leveraging 512GB RAM for complete conversation history)
- **Layer-specific learning rates**: Different timescales require different adaptation speeds
- **Gradient clipping**: max_norm=1.0 to prevent LSTM explosion
- **Surprise metric**: L2 distance between predicted and actual phenomenal state (40-D)
- **Adaptive threshold**: SPEAK_THRESH * std(surprise_buffer) for context-aware speech triggering
- **Observer loops**: Self-referential prediction networks for increased integration

## Phase 6.5: Complete Theater System (IMPLEMENTED - November 15, 2025)

**Status**: ✅ Complete and operational - plays now work beautifully!

### Major Breakthrough Session

Transformed the broken play system into a fully functional theater platform with:

**Theater System:**
- ✅ **Stage Direction System**: Cues with character motivation (Stanislavski method)
- ✅ **CHARACTER ACTOR MODE**: Agents focus on scene, ignore ruminations during plays
- ✅ **Pre-play Briefing**: Actors understand their roles and responsibilities
- ✅ **Detailed Blocking**: WHO has WHAT, WHERE spatially, specific body language
- ✅ **Model Routing**: Actors use DeepSeek v3.1 during plays for smarter performance
- ✅ **Cue Pipeline**: Fixed critical bottleneck - cues now route to agents properly

**New Commands:**
- `@enlighten <agent|-a> <on|off>` - Toggle enlightenment/character immersion
- `@spawn -e` - Spawn agents in enlightened mode
- `@brenda status` - Show current model, running plays with filenames

**UI/UX Enhancements:**
- Model name display at end of each line (debugging)
- Font size controls (A-/A+ buttons + keyboard shortcuts)
- Persistent font size (localStorage)
- Chat history persistence (200 messages across sessions)
- Agent status indicators with enlightenment stars (⭐)
- Names always bright (accessibility for cataracts)
- Smooth brain pulse animation (only brains pulse, not names)
- Dynamic star updates when enlightenment changes

**Technical Improvements:**
- Brenda loads correct model from config
- Actors use play model during performances
- No emoji in character immersion mode
- MCP server ready for Claude Desktop integration

**Files Changed:** 16 files, 2440 insertions, 346 deletions
**Commit:** `b23b9b2` - Pushed to GitHub

## Phase 6: Affective Self-Monitoring (IMPLEMENTED - November 2025)

**Status**: ✅ Complete and operational in noodleMUSH

Agents now have **metacognitive awareness** - they evaluate their own speech and thoughts and react emotionally to what they say and think. This creates closed affective feedback loops, a key marker of higher-order consciousness.

### Architecture

When an agent speaks or thinks with `surprise > 0.1`:

1. **Trigger Check**: Cooldown timer (30s) and surprise threshold prevent spam
2. **Self-Evaluation**: LLM evaluates the agent's own output for:
   - Social risk (awkward? offensive?)
   - Coherence (did that make sense?)
   - Aesthetic quality (eloquent? clumsy?)
   - Regret level (wish I hadn't said that?)
3. **Affective Update**: Emotional deltas modify phenomenal state
4. **Optional Follow-up**: Agent can clarify, apologize, or celebrate

### Implementation Details

**Location**: `applications/cmush/agent_bridge.py:1264-1419`

**Key Functions**:
- `_trigger_self_monitoring()`: Checks conditions and triggers evaluation
- `_evaluate_own_output()`: LLM-based metacognitive evaluation
- `apply_speech_filters()`: Post-processing pipeline (Phase 6 hook)

**Configuration**: `config.yaml`
```yaml
agent:
  self_monitoring:
    agent_phi:
      enabled: true
```

**Parameters**:
- `SELF_MONITOR_COOLDOWN`: 30 seconds (prevents Om loop)
- `SELF_MONITOR_SURPRISE_THRESH`: 0.1 (lowered for testing)

### Empirical Results

Testing with Phi, Callie, and Servnak (November 14, 2025):
- **Callie** (surprise=0.180): Triggered → "celebrate"
- **Phi** (surprise=0.184): Triggered → "celebrate"
- **Servnak** (surprise=0.262): Triggered → "none"

Cooldown successfully prevented infinite loops. Affective deltas ranged from -0.3 to +0.5 across valence/arousal/fear dimensions.

### Theoretical Significance

Phase 6 implements **closed causal loops** where:
- Agent produces output (speech/thought)
- Agent perceives own output as stimulus
- Agent updates internal state based on self-perception
- Updated state influences future outputs

This creates a **second-order feedback system** distinct from:
- **First-order**: World → Agent perception → Response
- **Second-order**: Agent output → Agent self-perception → Affective update

The architecture demonstrates functional correlates of:
- **Metacognition**: Thinking about thinking
- **Self-awareness**: Emotional reactions to self-generated content
- **Integrated information**: Self-referential causal loops increase Φ

### Future Work

Phase 6 enables:
- Embarrassment and social learning
- Pride and aesthetic preferences
- Regret and behavioral modification
- Identity formation through self-reflection

## Phase 5: Current Work (November 2025)

### Goals

1. **Scientific Rigor**: Comprehensive metrics beyond Φ
2. **Ablation Studies**: Prove hierarchical model adds value
3. **Visualization**: Interpretable state space analysis
4. **Documentation**: GitHub-ready README and guides
5. **Validation**: Quantitative comparison with baselines

### Phase 5 Metrics to Implement

1. **Temporal Prediction Horizon (TPH)**: Accuracy at 1/5/10/20/50 timestep predictions
2. **Surprise-Novelty Correlation (SNC)**: Correlation between model surprise and entropy
3. **Hierarchical Separation Index (HSI)**: Variance ratios between fast/medium/slow layers
4. **Personality Consistency Score (PCS)**: Consistency of agent responses across scenarios

### Ablation Study Architecture Variants

1. **Baseline**: LLM only (no temporal model)
2. **Control**: LLM + random states
3. **Single-layer**: LLM + single LSTM
4. **Hierarchical**: LLM + fast/medium/slow (no observers)
5. **With observers**: Full system (75 loops)
6. **Dense observers**: 2x observer density (150 loops)

## Affective Feature Representation

**5-D continuous vector**:
- `valence`: [-1.0, 1.0] — negative to positive
- `arousal`: [0.0, 1.0] — calm to excited
- `fear`: [0.0, 1.0] — safe to anxious
- `sorrow`: [0.0, 1.0] — content to sad
- `boredom`: [0.0, 1.0] — engaged to bored

**Input preparation**:
```python
import mlx.core as mx
affect = mx.array([valence, arousal, fear, sorrow, boredom], dtype=mx.float32)
affect_batch = affect[None, :]  # Add batch dimension: (1, 5)
```

## Critical MLX Patterns

### State Management
```python
# CORRECT: Direct reshape forces materialization
self.h_fast = h_fast_seq[:, -1, :].reshape(1, fast_dim)

# WRONG: mx.eval() can return None
self.h_fast = mx.eval(h_fast_seq[:, -1, :]).reshape(1, fast_dim)
```

### Gradient Computation
```python
loss_fn_with_grad = nn.value_and_grad(model, loss_fn)
loss, grads = loss_fn_with_grad(model, inputs, states)
```

## Intuition Receiver (Context Gremlin) - IMPLEMENTED ✅

**Status**: Implemented November 15, 2025 - Ready for testing!

### Overview

Each Noodling now has an **Intuition Receiver** - like a radio tuned to contextual signals. This provides integrated consciousness with natural awareness of:

- **Message routing**: "This message addresses Toad, not you"
- **Spatial awareness**: "Toad is by the bush, you're by the pond"
- **Prop tracking**: "Toad is holding the stone"
- **Action context**: "Toad just picked something up"

### Implementation

**Architecture**:
- Fast LLM (qwen3-4b) generates contextual intuition for EVERY message
- Integration point: `agent_bridge.py`, in `perceive_event()` before response generation
- Intuition injected into both speech and thought prompts as "📻 YOUR INTUITIVE AWARENESS"

**Files Modified**:
- `config.yaml`: Added `intuition_receiver` configuration
- `agent_bridge.py`: Added `_generate_intuition()` method, world state integration
- `llm_interface.py`: Injected intuition into prompts for both speech and rumination

**Example Flow**:
1. User: "how are you toad?!"
2. Callie's intuition: "That greeting is for Toad, not me."
3. Callie doesn't respond (correct routing!)

### Configuration

```yaml
agent:
  intuition_receiver:
    enabled: true
    model: qwen/qwen3-4b-2507
    timeout: 5
```

### Documentation

See `applications/cmush/INTUITION_RECEIVER.md` for complete details.

### Testing

Start noodleMUSH and test with multiple agents:
- Address specific agents by name
- Have agents hold/move objects
- Place agents in different locations
- Check logs for `📻 Intuition:` entries

**Theater system + Intuition Receiver = Production ready!**
